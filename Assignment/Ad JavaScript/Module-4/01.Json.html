    <h1>What is Json ?</h1>
    <p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page. JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand. JSON arrays are written inside square brackets. Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects. A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value</p>
